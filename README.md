# Live-Transcribe
Live Transcribe is an app that provides free, real-time, speech-to-text transcriptions to make everyday conversations more accessible among people who are deaf 
and hard-of-hearing, using just your web browser. Using Google's state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition technology, Live Transcribe shows speech and sound 
as text on your screen, so you can participate in conversations going on in the world around you more easily. 

## Future development
- enable user to type responses on the screen, 
- get alerts when user's name is spoken, 
- search within transcriptions.
